This group project consisted on making a kind of fanzine from that letter that he wrote to his grandmother, based on the concept of self-publishing and more alternative/underground publications. It consists of an blue-and-orange illustrated booklet and postcards with anonymous messages from several people to their loved ones. Most of the photographs used for this project are family photos of the two designers.</p>

This project is the redesign of that book, based on concepts such as hybrid novel and visual writing. By adding different kinds of illustrative elements, the original sense of the story is not only ‘visually translated’, but also expanded - through the relationship between the narrative and the images next to it. The illustrations were made using vintage advertisings, engravings and old photographs.</p>

The objective was to design a clean and ‘noise-free’ interface so the focus would be directed at what the user is reading. It would allow its users to explore all kinds of poetry genres and discover new poems, as well as write their own and choose to archive or share it. This was an interface design project, resulting on an invision prototype where you can experience what Haven would be and look like.<br><a href="https://invis.io/5VPJT7IASU7">Check it out here!</a></p>

The briefing for this project was to create an object about a site of public interest that should be promoted. I created a narrative that tells the history of these Gardens, merging facts and fiction, resulting on a 6-part narrative told by ‘former residents’ of the Gardens. All the illustrations were hand drawn and coloured, scanned and edited, and I also designed the all-caps font used on the title.
