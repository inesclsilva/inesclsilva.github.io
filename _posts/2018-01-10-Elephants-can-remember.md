Elephants can remember is a book written by Agatha Christie, in 1972, part of the series about Poirot's cases. This project is the redesign of that book, based on concepts such as hybrid novel and visual writing. By adding different kinds of illustrative elements, the original sense of the story is not only ‘visually translated’, but also expanded - through the relationship between the narrative and the images next to it. The illustrations were made using vintage advertisings, engravings and old photographs.
