myRNE is the mobile app for the Portuguese bus company Rede Nacional de Expressos. With this app, people can buy bus tickets to more than 50 destinations, from the north to the south of Portugal.
Focused on consistency an easy-to-use experience, the goal of this redesign is to simplify the main objective of this app: the purchase of bus tickets. You can check the [InVision prototype here](https://invis.io/8CS7I8P4T7K) or learn a bit more about the project on [my behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/81208927/Rede-Expressos-Mobile-app)
