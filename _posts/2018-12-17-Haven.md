Haven was designed to be a webapp to read, write and share poetry. The objective was to design a clean and ‘noise-free’ interface so the focus would be directed at what the user is reading. It would allow its users to explore all kinds of poetry genres and discover new poems, as well as write their own and choose to archive or share it. This was an interface design project, resulting on an invision prototype where you can experience what Haven would be and look like.
