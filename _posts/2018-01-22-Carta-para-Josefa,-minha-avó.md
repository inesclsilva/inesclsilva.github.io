Carta para Josefa, minha avó is a 1978 chronicle by the Portuguese Nobel prize winner José Saramago. This group project consisted on making a kind of fanzine from that letter that he wrote to his grandmother, based on the concept of self-publishing and more alternative/underground publications. It consists of an blue-and-orange illustrated booklet and postcards with anonymous messages from several people to their loved ones. Most of the photographs used for this project are family photos of the two designers.
