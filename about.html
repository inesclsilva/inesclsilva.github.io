Born and raised in Lisbon, Portugal, I’ve been gracing the world with my existence since 1997.
I’m a UX Designer on the very beginning of my career, currently working as a trainee at the Portuguese digital agency Wingman.
My main areas of interest are Web Design and Development, User Experience and User Interface (UX & UI), Editorial Design and Illustration.
